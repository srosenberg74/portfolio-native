          ><br />I am truly blessed to be an Alphaworks Apprentice. For one
          year I am being paid to do what I love, learn! Lead by Juan Lucero,
          an amazing and experienced Web Designer, and with an incredible group
          of apprentices, I am learning and honing more and more of the skills I
          will need to succeed in the tech world everyday.
